PROPRIETARY SOURCE-AVAILABLE LICENSE AGREEMENT

EFFECTIVE DATE: 16 FEBRUARY 2026

LICENSOR:
Lukas Harzbecker (natural person), Germany

SOFTWARE:
"BetterMetas" — all past, present and future versions, source code, binaries, documentation, and related materials

1. DEFINITIONS
1.1 "Agreement" means this Proprietary Source-Available License Agreement as amended in writing.
1.2 "Licensor" means the person named above.
1.3 "Licensee" means any natural person or legal person who accepts this Agreement.
1.4 "Software" has the meaning stated above.
1.5 "Excluded Person" refers specifically to the individual named above.
1.6 "Authorized Distribution Channels" means (a) The official GitHub repository controlled by Licensor; (b) Licensor’s designated download endpoints (including [NAME].hzb.app); and (c) Any other source expressly authorized by Licensor.

2. ACCEPTANCE / FORMATION OF CONTRACT
2.1 This Agreement is an offer by Licensor. A binding license is formed when Licensee accepts by (i) downloading, cloning, copying, installing, or using the Software, in whole or in part, from an Authorized Distribution Channel or any other source; or (ii) clicking an express "I accept" or equivalent control.
2.2 Licensee acknowledges that the Software may be viewable on public platforms for informational purposes only; any copying, downloading, or use of the Software (in whole or in part) constitutes full acceptance of this Agreement.

3. GRANT OF LICENSE — SCOPE AND LIMITS
3.1 Subject to strict compliance with all terms of this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited license to:
   (a) access, download and use the Software solely for private, personal, educational or informational purposes; and
   (b) inspect and modify source code solely for private study, experimentation, improvement, or bug fixing ("Private Modifications").
3.2 No other rights are granted. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Licensor.

4. RESTRICTIONS
4.1 No Distribution: Licensee shall not distribute, publish, disclose, sublicense, assign, lease, rent, loan, sell, or otherwise make the Software or any Private Modifications available to any third party. Public posting, public fork, public mirror or any publicly accessible copy requires Licensor’s prior explicit written consent executed by an authorized representative of Licensor.
4.2 No Circumvention/Reverse Engineering: Licensee shall not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive proprietary mechanisms from compiled components, except to the extent that mandatory statutory law in the Licensee’s jurisdiction expressly permits such acts. Where law mandates exceptions (e.g., for interoperability or error correction), Licensee’s actions must be strictly limited to the scope and purpose defined by that law.
4.3 No Commercial Use: Any commercial use — including but not limited to resale, provision of paid services, monetization, or internal business use — is strictly prohibited absent a separate, written commercial license executed by Licensor.
4.4 Private Forks: Any fork or copy made by Licensee for private use must remain inaccessible to the public or third parties. Licensee shall ensure appropriate repository privacy settings, access controls, and account management to prevent public disclosure.

5. CONTRIBUTIONS AND FEEDBACK (CONTRIBUTOR AGREEMENT)
5.1 By submitting any contribution (including patches, pull requests, feedback, documentation or other materials) to Licensor, the contributor grants Licensor an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable and sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish, distribute, relicense and otherwise exploit such contributions, without obligation of attribution or compensation.
5.2 Contributor represents and warrants that Contributor has the full right, power and authority to grant the license in clause 5.1 and that the contribution does not infringe the rights of any third party.
5.3 Contributor also warrants that Contributor is not the Excluded Person and that no contribution is submitted on behalf of, for the benefit of, or at the direction of the Excluded Person. Any false representation is a material breach and entitles Licensor to immediate remedies.

6. SPECIFIC PERSONAL EXCLUSION — ENFORCEMENT
6.1 Absolute Exclusion: Notwithstanding any other provision, no license, permission, authorization or right of any kind under this Agreement is granted to the Excluded Person. Licensor declines to enter into any contract with the Excluded Person.
6.2 Representation and Certification: By accepting this Agreement, Licensee warrants and certifies under penalty of material breach that (a) Licensee is not the Excluded Person and (b) Licensee does not act for, on behalf of, or at the direction or control of the Excluded Person. Licensee shall notify Licensor immediately upon any change in circumstances that would make the foregoing untrue.
6.3 Identity Verification: Where legally permissible and proportionate, Licensor may require reasonable identity verification for access via Authorized Distribution Channels (for example, confirmation of an active GitHub account username, authenticated email address tied to the account, or similar non-sensitive verification). Any processing of personal data in connection with verification will be limited to what is necessary, lawful, and proportionate and shall be subject to Licensor’s privacy notice.
6.4 Platform Measures: Licensor may employ practical platform measures to effect the exclusion, including (without limitation) hosting the authoritative source in a private GitHub Organization controlled by Licensor, using platform blocking/moderation tools, reporting violations to platform operators, and restricting invitation or collaboration rights. Use of any platform tool is supplemental to, and does not replace, contractual and statutory rights.
6.5 Automatic Termination; Remedies: If Licensor reasonably determines that the Excluded Person has accessed or used the Software (including via impersonation, proxy, intermediary, or by using another person’s account), any license that would otherwise apply is automatically and immediately void with respect to that person. Licensor is entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity, including immediate injunctive relief, takedown notices (DMCA or equivalent), monetary damages, and reimbursement of enforcement costs and attorneys' fees to the extent permitted by law.
6.6 Duty to Destroy and Certificate: Upon termination or discovery of unauthorized use by the Excluded Person, the party through which access occurred must immediately destroy all copies and certify in writing to Licensor within seven (7) days that no copies remain under their control.

7. PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY & PUBLIC HOSTING
7.1 Platform Acknowledgement: Licensee acknowledges that public code-hosting platforms (including GitHub) provide technical features (public forks, clones, mirrored copies) that may allow copying or viewing of public repositories irrespective of license text. Platform features do not, by themselves, create a license or permission to use the Software contrary to this Agreement.
7.2 Controlled Distribution: Licensor will, at Licensor’s election, maintain primary authoritative releases via Authorized Distribution Channels. To assert full rights under this Agreement, downstream users must accept this Agreement at the point of access.
7.3 Notices and DMCA: Licensee agrees that Licensor may use platform notice-and-takedown procedures (DMCA or equivalent) and platform reporting mechanisms to enforce Licensor’s rights, and Licensee shall cooperate reasonably with such enforcement efforts.

8. OWNERSHIP
8.1 All title, ownership, and intellectual property rights in and to the Software, including copyrights, trade secrets, moral rights to the extent permitted by law, trademarks and any other proprietary rights, remain exclusively with Licensor. No transfer of ownership is effected by this Agreement.

9. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER & LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
9.1 No Warranty: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING.
9.2 Limitation of Liability: To the extent permitted by applicable law:
   (a) Licensor is liable without limitation for damages caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence, and for injury to life, body or health;
   (b) For slight negligence, Licensor is liable only for breach of essential contractual obligations and liability is limited to foreseeable, typical damages at the time of contract formation; and
   (c) Any other liability is excluded.
9.3 Mandatory Rights Preserved: Nothing in this Agreement limits or excludes liability that cannot be limited or excluded under mandatory law, including consumer protection laws and applicable product liability statutes.

10. DATA PROTECTION
10.1 To the extent Licensor processes personal data for identity verification or enforcement, Licensor will process only the minimum data reasonably necessary, will do so lawfully and proportionately, and will provide a privacy notice and information about data subject rights in accordance with applicable data protection law.

11. TERM, TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL
11.1 This Agreement is effective upon acceptance and remains in force until terminated.
11.2 Licensor may terminate the license granted hereunder for any material breach, including a breach of clause 6 (Excluded Person) or clause 4 (Restrictions). Upon termination, Licensee shall immediately cease use and destroy all copies of the Software and certify destruction as set out in clause 6.6.
11.3 Sections that by their nature survive termination (including Ownership, Warranty Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability, Data Protection, Contributions, and Remedies) shall survive.

12. SEVERABILITY, INTEGRATION, AMENDMENT
12.1 If any provision is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement remains in full force. The parties shall replace any invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely carries out the original intent.
12.2 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications.
12.3 Licensor may amend this Agreement prospectively by posting a revised version on an Authorized Distribution Channel and providing reasonable notice; continued use after notice constitutes acceptance only to the extent legally effective.

13. GOVERNING LAW & JURISDICTION
13.1 Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding its conflict-of-laws rules and excluding the CISG to the extent it might otherwise apply.
13.2 Jurisdiction: If Licensee is a merchant, a legal person under public law, or has no general venue in Germany, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for disputes shall be Licensor’s place of residence in Germany. Licensor reserves the right to bring proceedings at Licensee’s place of jurisdiction. Mandatory consumer protection jurisdiction rules remain unaffected.

14. APPLICATION TO PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE VERSIONS
14.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, this Agreement applies to all past, present and future versions of the Software insofar as Licensee’s continued access or use occurs after acceptance of this Agreement. Where mandatory law requires renewed consent for material changes, Licensor will seek such consent and continued use after notice shall constitute acceptance only where legally effective.

15. REMEDIES; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
15.1 Licensee acknowledges that breach of clause 6 (Excluded Person) or clause 4 (Restrictions) may cause Licensor irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Licensor is therefore entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief (including ex parte relief where permitted) in addition to other remedies.
