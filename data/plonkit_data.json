For example, Tien Giang is abbreviated TG. These can be especially useful to learn by heart to get an edge over your opponent.\n\nIt is important to note that Vietnam is currently undergoing an administrative reform, combining most provinces into larger provinces, reducing the number of provinces significantly. Google hasn\u2019t updated its map to reflect this change yet, but it is expected to happen soon. This makes learning the provinces by heart even more important: the overwhelming majority of coverage will be from before the administrative reform, meaning that in the near future, you cannot simply scan the map for some of the provinces\u2019 names.\n\nThere are lots of resources available to learn the province names and abbreviations.

Trekkers can be recognized by the fact that the camera is lower to the ground, having smaller blurs, and no car shadow.\n\nInstead of learning a lot of country-specific clues, it is more practical to simply memorise what the trekkers look like. There are seven sections of coverage, each centred around historic places of interest, ranging from the Pyramids to Coptic churches and medieval citadels.\n\nThe coverage is limited to two general areas:\n\nCairo: four trekkers.\n\nAlexandria: three trekkers, two of which are fairly far outside the city to its southwest (Monastery of Saint Mina and nearby archeological excavations).",

        "title": "Architecture Overview",
        "description": "Polish architecture is fairly similar to other Central European countries. Buildings usually have plain stone walls covered in light or pastel stucco. Frequent roofing colours are orange or red, black, and brown. Roof tiles and panes often have a tidy, almost plastic-like look. Some rural houses have corrugated sheet roofs similar to those often found in the Baltics.\n\nDetached single family homes are common throughout Poland. They sometimes have a blocky look.\n\nIn bigger towns, apartment buildings are common. Many date from communist times, and some of them still have a somewhat austere look. However, many have been renovated and look nice and well-kept.\n\nDowntown areas are usually dense and often have historic buildings.",

        "note": "While it is generally fairly flat, you will often see hills and mountains around you. However, as a general rule, the road itself will be mostly flat.",

In the centre, around the capital, the climate becomes less arid, leading to a temperate mediterranean climate. In the southernmost regions of Chile, which lie in the subantarctic zone, the climate is cold and wet, leading to a cool oceanic climate.\n\nYou can click on the image to enlarge it.",
